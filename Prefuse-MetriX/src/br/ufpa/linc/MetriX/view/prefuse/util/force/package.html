<p>Utility classes providing a physical force simulation for layout and
animation. Force simulations consist of a series of force functions that
calculate forces acting on data elements, and an integrator that determines
how these calculated forces effect the position and velocity of these elements
over time. The {@link br.ufpa.linc.MetriX.view.prefuse.util.force.ForceSimulator} class keeps track of
which elements should be included in the simulation, as well as which 
{@link br.ufpa.linc.MetriX.view.prefuse.util.force.Force} functions and
{@link br.ufpa.linc.MetriX.view.prefuse.util.force.Integrator} are used.</p>

<p>To create your own custom simulations, create a new ForceSimulator instance
and add the desired force functions. Custom force functions can be introduced
by subclassing {@link br.ufpa.linc.MetriX.view.prefuse.util.force.AbstractForce} or implementing the 
{@link br.ufpa.linc.MetriX.view.prefuse.util.force.Force} interface.
Additionally, the {@link br.ufpa.linc.MetriX.view.prefuse.util.ui.JForcePanel} user interface component
can be used during development to explore different parameterizations of the 
various force functions until a desired behavior is found.</p>
