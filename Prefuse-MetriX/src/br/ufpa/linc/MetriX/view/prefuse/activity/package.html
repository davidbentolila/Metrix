<p>General classes for scheduling and running activities
with specified starting times and durations. Used by all
{@link br.ufpa.linc.MetriX.view.prefuse.action.Action} implementations, these activities can be
used to perform scheduled data processing and animation. Pacers can be
used to control the rate of animation, for example, providing slow-in
slow-out animated transitions.</p>
