<p>Classes implementing an SQL-like expression language for filtering and manipulating data.
The base type of the language, {@link br.ufpa.linc.MetriX.view.prefuse.data.expression.Expression}, represents a 
calculation over a single
tuple at a time. Expressions can be created programatically by instantiating
the desired classes of this package, or can be compiled from a textual
language with a SQL-like syntax by the
{@link br.ufpa.linc.MetriX.view.prefuse.data.expression.parser.ExpressionParser} class.</p>
